/**
 * Structure:
 * A structure is a user-defined data type that lets you group variables of different types under one name.
 * Each variable in the structure is known as a member of the structure.
 * Unlike an array, a structure can contain many different data types (int, float, char, etc.).
 * You can also assign values to members of a structure variable at declaration time, in a single line.
 *
 * Key Points about Structures:
 * Each member has its own memory.
 * If int = 4 bytes, float = 4 bytes, char[20] = 20 bytes â†’ total = ~28 bytes (may include padding).
 * You can access members using . (dot operator).
 * Multiple variables of a structure type can be created.
 * @param argc
 * @param argv
 * @return
